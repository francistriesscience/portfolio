In this post, I'll walk you through how I built this portfolio website using modern web technologies.

## Technology Stack

For this project, I chose a modern tech stack that provides excellent performance and developer experience:

### Frontend Framework

- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework

### UI Components

- **Shadcn/ui** - Modern component library
- **Radix UI** - Accessible component primitives
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful icons

### Additional Tools

- **MDX** - Markdown with JSX for blog posts
- **Next Themes** - Dark/light theme support
- **ESLint** - Code linting and formatting

## Project Structure

```tsx
Hello
```

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. File-Based Routing

Next.js App Router automatically creates routes based on the file structure in the `app` directory.

### 2. MDX Support

I integrated MDX to write blog posts with both markdown and React components:

```jsx
import { Callout } from "@/components/callout"

# My Blog Post

This is a regular markdown paragraph.

<Callout type="info">
  This is a custom React component inside markdown!
</Callout>
```

### 3. Responsive Design

The portfolio is fully responsive and works great on all devices.

### 4. Dark Mode Support

Built-in theme switching with smooth transitions.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: MDX Integration

**Problem**: Setting up MDX with Next.js App Router
**Solution**: Used `@next/mdx` with proper configuration and custom components

### Challenge: Dynamic Routing

**Problem**: Creating dynamic blog post pages
**Solution**: File-based routing with `[slug]` dynamic segments

## Performance Optimizations

- **Static Generation**: Blog posts are statically generated at build time
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js built-in image optimization
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting for better performance
- **Tree Shaking**: Unused code is automatically removed

## Conclusion

Building this portfolio was a great learning experience. I got to work with cutting-edge technologies and implement modern web development best practices.

The result is a fast, accessible, and maintainable portfolio that showcases both my technical skills and my work.
